# SRF_Library
This is Arduino library for Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
---
### Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of the nearest object, sending the result to the serial port. It can work from 2 cm to 3 m. It measures the time spent by the signal to reach the object and return to the sensor.
##### SRF05 
The latest model SRF05 Detection range of 3 cm from the original SRF04 -3 m, increased to 1 cm -4 meters. RF04 is compatible with the original. Also has smaller side lobes. 

Ultrasonic module can be used to identify obstructions, 1 cm -4 meters. Can be easily connected to the micro-controller, such as BASICX. 

The ultrasound module will be applied to the robot module. With this module, available in the sonar obstacle within the exact distance. Your robot will be able to bat-like sonar to detect by the surroundings, only a small piece of code, you can obstacles to accurate distance control your motor running, so that your robot can easily of avoiding obstacles.
